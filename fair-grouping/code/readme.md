In this paper, we introduce a multi-fair capacitated (MFC) grouping problem that fairly partitions students into non-overlapping groups while ensuring balanced group cardinalities (with a lower and an upper bound), and maximizing the diversity of members regarding the protected attribute. To obtain the MFC grouping, we propose three approaches: a greedy heuristic approach, a knapsack-based approach using vanilla maximal knapsack formulation, and an MFC knapsack approach based on group fairness knapsack formulation. Experimental results on a real dataset and a semi-synthetic dataset show that our proposed methods can satisfy studentsâ€™ preferences and deliver balanced and diverse groups regarding cardinality and the protected attribute, respectively. <br>

## Correction!
The number of wishes <b> h=5 </b> for Student performance dataset (in the paper it is written incorrectly, <b>h = 3 </b>). The CPLEX model is reported only in case <b> h=5 </b>.
The results of our proposed models when the number of wishes <b>h = 3</b> are shown in two Notebook: <b> Student-mat-h3.ipynb </b> and <b>Student-por-h3.ipynb </b>
