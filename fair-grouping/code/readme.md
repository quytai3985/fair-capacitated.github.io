### Correction!
The number of wishes <b> h=5 </b> for Student performance dataset (in the paper it is written incorrectly, <b>h = 3 </b>). The CPLEX model is reported only in case <b> h=5 </b>.
The results of our proposed models when the number of wishes <b>h = 3</b> are shown in two Notebook: <b> Student-mat-h3.ipynb </b> and <b>Student-por-h3.ipynb </b>
