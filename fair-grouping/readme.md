In this paper, we introduce a multi-fair capacitated (MFC) grouping problem that fairly partitions students into non-overlapping groups while ensuring balanced group cardinalities (with a lower and an upper bound), and maximizing the diversity of members regarding the protected attribute. To obtain the MFC grouping, we propose three approaches: a greedy heuristic approach, a knapsack-based approach using vanilla maximal knapsack formulation, and an MFC knapsack approach based on group fairness knapsack formulation. Experimental results on a real dataset and a semi-synthetic dataset show that our proposed methods can satisfy studentsâ€™ preferences and deliver balanced and diverse groups regarding cardinality and the protected attribute, respectively. <br>
